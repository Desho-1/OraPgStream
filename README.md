# 🚀 OraPgStream

**OraPgStream** is a lightweight, agentless Change Data Capture (CDC) tool that streams data changes from **Oracle** to **PostgreSQL** in near real-time using LogMiner.

Built for **simplicity**, **control**, and **speed**, OraPgStream runs entirely in your environment — no external services, no complex infrastructure.

## ✨ Key Features

- ⚡ Fast to install — up and running in minutes  
- 🔄 real-time CDC using Oracle LogMiner  
- 🧠 SCN-based tracking for reliable replay
- 📁 Schema‑level replication  
- 🔒 Fully local — no external connections  
- 🛠️ Simple and transparent architecture  
- 🔁 Automatic resume from last processed state 
- 📊 Applies changes in **batches** for better performance
- 📦 Lightweight (Python-based, minimal dependencies)


## 🧩 How It Works
Oracle (Redo Logs / LogMiner)
-->
OraPgStream (CDC Engine)
-->
PostgreSQL (Apply Engine)

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Oracle Client
- PostgreSQL instance (accessible)

### Required Python packages:
- `oracledb`
- `psycopg2`
- `pyyaml`


## ⚠️ Important: Before running OraPgStream
- OraPgStream is designed to complement tools like ora2pg. Use ora2pg for the initial load (schema + data), then use OraPgStream to stream ongoing changes in real time.
-  Enable LogMiner (Oracle), Run the following as a privileged user: 

```sql
-- Enable supplemental logging (required for CDC)
ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA;
ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (ALL) COLUMNS;

-- Build LogMiner dictionary in redo logs
EXEC DBMS_LOGMNR_D.BUILD(
  OPTIONS => DBMS_LOGMNR_D.STORE_IN_REDO_LOGS
);
```

## 📝 Notes
These steps are mandatory for accurate CDC
- ⚠️ This tool interacts with database internals (LogMiner, system views). Ensure proper privileges are granted before execution.
- 💡 For better performance under load, consider increasing:

- PGA (pga_aggregate_target, pga_aggregate_limit)
- Shared Pool (shared_pool_size)

*(Tune based on your system capacity and workload)*

# ▶️ Getting Started

- download OraPgStream.tar.gz, PgApply.tar.gz & install.sh
- bash install.sh
- source venv/bin/activate
- run `./OraPgStream`
### ⚠️ Note: OraPgStream runs continuously as a live replication tool
To stop replication safely, press `Ctrl+C`.

## 🔍 What OraPgStream Does
- Reads changes from Oracle using LogMiner
- Tracks progress using SCN (System Change Number)
- Converts Oracle redo into executable SQL
- Applies changes to PostgreSQL in batches
- Logs all operations for full visibility

## 🔒 Security & Transparency
- ✅ Runs entirely locally
- ✅ No external API calls
- ✅ No data leaves your environment
- ✅ Full logging and traceability
